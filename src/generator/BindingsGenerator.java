/**
 * The java-gnome code generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The biggest problem architecturally is transforming information from the
 * form that the upstream .gir data provides to one we can do something useful
 * with in our context. The code generator, then is essentially two separate
 * pieces that have nothing to do with each other:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>At the front end is the .gir file parser. IntrospectionParser takes an
 * input file of GNOME GIR XML metadata and turns it into an array of Block
 * objects. Blocks are Java objects representing the contents of a given XML
 * description.
 * 
 * <li>Completely independent of the parser is the code generator. A hierarchy
 * of Generator objects exist with the code to output the necessary Java and C
 * code They have constructors which minutely specify the information they
 * require (and with variables names that means something to the task of
 * bindings generation, rather than whatever the origin .gir data might have
 * called it). The types information describing the underlying library is
 * stored in a hash table of which uses the underlying type (as found in the
 * source .gir data) as a key, and a Thing object as the value containing all
 * the necessary mappings of that type to the actual Java or C language type
 * used at each layer of the bindings.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The link between the two sides are the createThing() and createGenerator()
 * methods in each Block object; this is where we translate from the
 * characteristic key names in the .gir data to the names we use in the
 * generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To generate the java-gnome bindings, we therefore do several things:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>register all the type information: We load each .gir file and create
 * arrays of Blocks. We then stash these Blocks in an a class called DefsFile.
 * Along the way we call each Block's createThing() and then Thing.register()
 * to store the the resultant in our lookup table.
 * 
 * <li>parse data to override known .gir data: We load each .defs file and
 * create arrays of Blocks. The .defs file may contain a full description of
 * an object but also a single function, method or signal to add to the
 * original data taken from the Introspection XML.
 * 
 * <li>with a full database of type information in hand, we can then do an
 * iteration over the Block arrays to actually generate the code that goes
 * with each stanza. We get the appropriate Generator object by calling each
 * Block's createGenerator() method and then run its writeTranslationCode()
 * and writeJniCode() methods to finally emit the generated translation layer
 * (Java) and jni layer (C) code.
 * </ol>
